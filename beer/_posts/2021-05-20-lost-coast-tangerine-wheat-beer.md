## Smell

Smells like tangerines.
Aimee says it is just like the tangerine soda she drank as a child.

Candylike.
That's it.
It does smell like tangerine,
but tangerine candy.
Something cheap and sweet.

## Taste

The taste is more interesting.
Not overly sweet.

It tastes like a wheat beer with tangerine.

Like the recent habenero beer we had,
this strikes me as two mediocre things adding up to something mediocre,
unlike the watermelon wheat beer that was a surprise and refreshing.

Tasting notes: tangerine, wheat. Yup.

The bitterness is unpleasant,
aftertaste is unpleasant.

Aftertaste is unpleasant.

## Mouthfeel

## Overall

Bleh.

Aimee says it is worse than the cheap
tangerine soda she drank as a child.
