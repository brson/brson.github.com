## Appearance

Pours beautifully.
Looks thick and syrupy,
like mango juice.

Head dissipates fast.

## Smell

Sour and fruity.
Mango.

Aimee discovers in it "baked sweet potato",
or a sweet potato casserole.
Also cantaloupe.

"It's so complicated".

The smell is not as strong as I expected,
and it's not as inviting as I expected.

Let's see how it affects the taste.

## Taste

It is sour juice.

I can't help but think this type of thing would be better
to start with a can of gose,
and mix it with fresh juice,
instead of having the juice sitting in the can.

It is not very beer-like.

It does taste relatively good.

## Mouthfeel

Thick.
A sediment remains on the walls of the glass.

## Overall

I can see this being enjoyed by somebody who doesn't love the taste of beer,
but that person I don't think would be likely to find this beer at all.

It's so thick though that you can't drink a lot of it.

It's ok for what it is,
but I've had juiced beers that I liked better.
