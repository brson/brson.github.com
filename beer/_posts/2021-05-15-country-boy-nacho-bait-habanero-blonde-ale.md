Nacho Bait Habenero Blonde Ale.
Country Boy Brewing.
Georgetown, KY.

ABV not listed.

Ale brewed with habanero.

We've done a fair bit of cooking with habanero and other peppers recently.
Interested to see how a hot pepper beer tastes.

## Appearance

Semi-translucent orange, moderate head.

## Smell

It does smell like habanero.
But not like fresh, delicious habanero;
like habanero that's been processed and sitting in a can since January 29.

Hard to get anything else out of it.

## Taste

We make scrunchy faces and laugh a lot on the first drink.
It has a slight habanero burn,
and tastes like habanero.

It's hard to make any tasting notes when the aftertaste is just peppery-hot.

It's not complex or interesting,
just slightly hot and tastes like habanero,
but it also tastes lie the worst habanero-derived food flavoring you've ever eaten,
not like a deliciously fresh habanero.

I can't appreciate the beer qualities of this in any way.
Without the habanero would this be a good beer?
I have no idea and kind of don't want to think about it.
My mouth is justly lightly on fire.

## Mouthfeel

Whatever I don't care at this point.

## Overall

This feels wrong:
when eating spicy food,
a crisp beer is the perfect accompaniment.
What is this the perfect accompaniment for?
Something bland surely.
Or something sour.
Or maybe ice cream.

Aimee serves some pickled ginger,
and I momentarily hope that the two are a pair.

But they are not.

I challenge Aimee:
"we've had some bad beers. Is this the worst we've had?"
And she rightly recalls that the Brewdog near-beer was definitely the worst.
I can think of a couple others that I was repulsed by.

So this is not the worst beer we've had!

Aimee seems to like it more than me.
I hate it.
We don't finish it.

This is bad beer dressed up with a bad gimmick.
Make a good beer first,
then add the garbage.
I remain willing to dry a delicious NEIPA with some habanero in it.
