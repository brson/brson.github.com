The Calling Double IPA.
Boulevard Brewing Co.
Kansas City, MO.

8.5% ABV.

The can claims to have eight hops.
Mixing so many ingredients is something I'm skeptical of &mdash;
I'd rather just show off the best of a few ingredients &mdash;
and the last beer I had that boasted of lots of ingredients was a mess;
but let's see what we've got here.

This brewery makes a bourbon barrel stout that, at the time,
was my favorite of the style.

## Appearance

Medium head that dissipates quickly into big, bulbous bubbles.
Cloudy orange appearance.

5


## Smell

Smells like oranges from a foot away during the pour.
Tangerines, perhaps.

That's it.

## Taste

That is delicious.
Pretty much a perfect hazy, citrusy, IPA.

Some strong acidity.
Balanced biterness.
Only a bit of sweetness.

Orange rind.

The bitterness is particurly biting,
but surprisingly it's not overwhelming,
like some IPAs that are characterized only by biterness.

5


## Mouthfeel

Smooth enough, with a bit of lingering mouth-coating.

## Overall

This is a prototypical modern hazy IPA.
It's great.
