## Appearance

Light straw and hazy.
Big foamy head with tight lacing.

This beer trickeled down the can and made a mess during the pour,
but it's just a normal can,
so it must have been my error.

## Smell

It smells interesting during the pour.
Vivid melon. Cantaloupe.

## Taste

I say "oh my goodness. Come taste this."

Watermelon.

It's yummy and not too sweet, only a little bitter.
I forgot this is a wheat beer &mdash; it's disguised a lot by the fruit,
but I can taste it.

Every time I come back to the glass I like it more.

Aimee says "when I drink that, I feel happy".

## Mouthfeel

Light.

## Overall

I am grateful to experience something new today.
This is quite a mellow and pleasing flavor.

Most novel beers with adjuncts are not successful experiments,
but this is a great discovery.

We drink through this one fast.
