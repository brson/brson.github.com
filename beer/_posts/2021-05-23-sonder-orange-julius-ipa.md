## Appearance

Super hazy orange.
Looks creamy.
Creamy head.

## Smell

Citrusy. Mango, pineapple, orange.

Aimee says "tangerine, not orange".

Sour.

The aroma is hindered by being in a small snifter glass,
and being outside in the wind.

## Taste

Like an alcoholic orange creamsicle.
I don't taste any lactose like you might expect in a hazy IPA with added fruit,
and I consider that a positive.

## Mouthfeel

Thick.

## Overall

Good beer,
enhanced by being in a taproom for the first time in a long time.
