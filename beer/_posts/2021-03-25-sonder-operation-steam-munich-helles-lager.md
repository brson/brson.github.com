## Appearance

Thick, foamy, white head.
Golden and transparent in the glass.

## Smell

Light, crisp, traditional, like a delicious lager.

A bit of sweet fruit, but not sure what kind.

It's faint.

## Taste

It does taste like a German-style lager.
It's very mild and inoffensive.

I don't really have any tasting notes.
It tastes like simple hops.

This is a perfectly fine summer drink,
but Aimee and I both agree we like the Dortmunder Gold better.

## Mouthfeel

Goes down easy.

Another typical lager.
