Translucent straw with a moderately foamy head.
Looks classic.

## Smell

Smell is faint.
I get nothing.

Aimee says "jasmine, very light".

Can smells a bit of ham. Yep.

## Taste

That's satisfying,
at first, but
there's something unusual here:
olives, or scallions or garlic.

It's more bitter than expect from a pilsner,
but I don't mind that.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth.

## Overall

It's ok.
Not a prefered pilsner for me.
