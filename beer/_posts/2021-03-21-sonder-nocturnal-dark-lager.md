Creamy tan head. Like stout.

## Smell

Smells like a stout! Huh.

Caramel. Coffee.

Subsequent smells don't give me much.
First smell was strong.
Now it doesn't smell interesting.

## Taste

The taste is interesting.
It does not taste like stout.
It tastes stoutish,
but not quite like stout.

Typical caramel, dark chocalate of a stout.

Aimee says "smokey". I agree. Ash.

Aftertaste is bitter,
a bit unpleasant.

## Mouthfeel

Pretty light.
Not as heavy as it looks.
Watery.

Quite drinkable for such a dark beer.

## Overall

It's incomparable to most lagers,
more like a porter.
I would not choose it over a good porter.

I have not had a beer like this before.

But it isn't great.
