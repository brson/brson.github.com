Sun Surfer Hawaiian Style IPA.
Platform Beer Co.
Cleveland, OH.

4.9% ABV.

Continuing to investigate IPAs with interesting adjuncts,
this time guava and pineapple.

OK, check out this labeling:

So educational. Best I've seen.


## Appearance

Not much head at all on the pour.
Surprisingly this isn't a hazy IPA.

Golden to amber.

## Smell

Wow. It's sweet like juice.
Guava.

I don't smell the pineapple.

That's it. Just juice.

Aimee discovers that the can _does_ smell like pineapple.
The poured beer does not, the can does.
Curious.

Can is pretty; labeling is great.

## Taste

Aimee says "hm",
and I say "hungh".

It's odd.

As with the previous juicy IPA we tried,
I find that the taste is not nearly as fruity as the smell,
with the biterness covering up a lot of the expected flavor.

The body is light.

I suspect that without the adjuncts this would be an uninteresting IPA.

The taste _is_ complex,
but the constituent flavors don't seem to work with each other.

It tastes bad.

## Mouthfeel

The mouthfeel is light.

## Overall

Super disappointing.
With all the ingredients spelled out on the can I was expecting something ... sophisticated.

This does have three types of hops I haven't heard of before,
so it seems quite an experimental beer.

There's probably too many ingredients in this beer,
and the sum is not greater than the parts.
