Saison Dupont.
Brasserie Dupont.
Tourpes, Belgium.

6.5% ABV.

The classic Saison.
Like the Andechs Doppelbock,
I drank a lot of these a few years ago while living in San Francisco.

Let's see what I think of them now.

## Appearance

Out of control head on the pour.
I made a mess of this one.
Huge creamy head.

Hazy orange.

## Smell

Sweet and sour and fruity.
Sour apple.

Aimee always surprises me with her tasting notes:
this time she says "ripe banana".

Then "candy, oh!".
I agree,
there's a citric acid, sour candy smell.

Banana? No banana.

It's a pleasantly different smell from what I am accustomed to.

## Taste

Mm, that's complex.
Not nearly as sweet as I expected.
Sour though,
but with an unexpected earthiness.
Grassy.
Mud.

Not as sweet,
nor as sour as I expected,
and more bitter.

Oh, I like that.
I think I would like it more if it was a little sweeter,
and a little less bitter.

The bottle describes it as "dry",
and that makes a lot of sense;
and I have not considered using the term to describe beer.

## Mouthfeel

Slightly soapy.

## Overall

Pleasantly surprised that I still like this one,
though it isn't as sour now,
nor quite as satisfying as it is in my memories.
It does interest me to explore other saisons.
