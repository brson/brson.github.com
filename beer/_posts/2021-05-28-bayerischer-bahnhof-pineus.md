Pineus.
Bayerischer Bahnhof.
Leipzig, Germany.

4.6% ABV.

This is a gose "brewed with coriander and salt, and filtered over pine needles".
Fascinating.

Having a difficult today today.
Will this cheer me up?

## Appearance

Hazy orange. Minimal head.

## Smell

Smell is interesting.
Sour and fruity.
Spicy.

All indeterminate notes for me though.
Probably one of them is coriander.
Probably another is pine.

## Taste

Definitely tastes like pie spices.
Sour.
I think I get the pine needles,
but it's hard to know,
since I don't have much pine needle experience.

Not sure the impact the salt is having,
but I know it is a common ingredient in gose.

A bit tough to drink.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth.

## Overall

Happy to have had this experience.
I'd like to try one without the coriander,
but still filtered over pine needles.
