Garage Beer Premium Lager.
Braxton Brewing.
Covington, KY.

4.0% ABV.

Across the river from Cincy,
can they brew a better beer?

## Appearance

Thick foamy head with big lacing.
Very pale translucent yellow.

## Smell

A typical macro-lager smell.

Aimee says "sweet like a summer flower",
and when I don't respond says,
"don't you think so?"

The flower she googles is jasmine.

I can get down with the idea of the beer smelling like flowers or plants,
but it's not what I get.

She also says "candy".

I should just let her do these tastings;
she has much more imaginative tastebuds than I.

I am determined to pick 1 tasting note for this aroma.

And it is ... seabreeze.

Screw it. Seabreeze.

Aimee disagrees.

## Taste

My first reaction:
"yeugh", with a bit of eye-rolling head-tilt.

It's a light lager.

Probably better than a Bud Lite,
but who can say.

I have lost interest.

I mean,
it tastes simple and inoffensive.
You could drink 10 of these.

## Mouthfeel

Closest beer to the mouthfeel of delicious, refreshing water.

## Overall

I am so frustrated.
