Happy Amber.
Madtree Brewing.
Cincinnati, OH.

6.0% ABV.

Madtree is a major Cincy brewery.
This is the third Madtree we've reviewed in Cincy.
Weren't impressed with the other two.

## Appearance

It is amber.
Can't see through it.
There was a head, but minimal.
What remains of it looks kinda like a petri dish,
or a crater-impacted planetary surface.

## Smell

Smelling the poured glass I only get a slight caramel.
The can though smells hoppy.
So interesting &mdash;
the can has much more aroma.

I get a bit of dried apricot from the can.
Fruit only revealed itself after airating a bit.

I accidentally inhale some beer by putting my nose too close.
I have done that too many times.
I get notes of teriyaki.

This beer smells different when it comes in direct contact with the inside of my nose.
Another interesting observation.

I rate this highly perhaps only because it's a different aroma
than I have experienced recently,
and it insipred some observations.

## Taste

This is balanced.
I was anticipating a lot of malt expression,
and I get the malt,
but it's also bitter.

We recently had an Andechs dopplebock that was super malty,
and I did not like much,
and that primed me for not enjoying a malty amber beer.

This is not though all that malty.

I have been thinking of amber-colored,
malt-oriented beers as boring lately,
and this changes that perception a bit.

Not that this is super-exciting,
but it's in the zone of beers I am happy to drink.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

This renews my interest in amber beers that lean toward malty flavors.
I want to try some more amber ales now.
