Vlad Pilsner.
Fretboard Brewing Company.
Blue Ash, OH.

5.3% ABV.

Aimee is into pilsners lately,
and I am certainly not going to turn down a refreshing brew.
We've enjoyed this one a few times.

We haven't been doing many tastings lately
because we've been frustrated at our inability to pick out interesting "notes".
We have ordered an beer-tasting aroma kit though,
so soon we will be able to train our noses better,
and level up our tasting notes.

## Appearance

It's hazy.
Haven't seen a hazy pilsner before.
I love hazy beers, so +1 for that.

It's a light gold color that is not actually that appealing though &mdash;
it looks a lot like the hazy non-alcoholic hazy IPAs that we have been completely disgusted by,
so -1 for that.

## Smell

Hints of nothing.
No smell.

Wait, let me try again.

Nope.
Nothing.

How can I score that?
Is no smell a good smell?
At least it's not a bad smell, right?

## Taste

It kinda doesn't have flavor either!

There's bitterness here.

This is fascinating.
We've drank most of a case of this,
and have been reasonably happy with it,
but when it comes down to describing it,
there's not much here.

It's not offensive &mdash;
there is nothing that tastes bad here.

Aimee: "I think it's sweet."

Me: "You think it's sweet?!"

Aimee: "I think it's _veny_ sweet."

Aimee: "It tastes a little bit bitter, but the bitter is hidden in the sweetness. It tastes good".

I'm determined that we both pick out a single "note".

I look at some of the hints on [beerflavorwheel.com](http://www.beerflavorwheel.com/).
I think this is in the "vegetal-cereal" zone, though also maybe the "surfury-acidic" zone.

Aimee picks "lemon-water".

I pick "battery acid".

There you go.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

I'm surprised that this was so hard to appreciate on close inspection,
when it's been a perfectly drinkable every-day beer.

There's nothing really special about it,
except the haziness in a pilsner.

It's not as good as the Wiedemmer's we had recently.
