Packaway Vienna Style Lager.
West Sixth Brewing.
Lexington, KY

5.3% ABV.

Not quite a Cincinnati brewery, but close enough.

I don't know what a "Vienna Style" lager is.

## Appearance

Frothy-headed pour.
Slightly murky amber.

## Smell

Mild. Apple juice.

Aimee says "melon". I ask what kind.
She says "I don't know - a little bit of watermelon",
does some googling and says "honeydew".

Aimee and I have completely different tastebuds.

## Taste

It's not sweet.

It's dull. Not quite boring.

Tastes like fermented grain!

I am having such a hard time identifying "tasting notes" in beers &mdash;
beers taste like beer.

Maybe I'm not creative enough. I'm a terrible beer-taster.

I am determined to name a tasting note. Here's one:
cardboard.
But have I ever tasted cardboard? No, I don't recall such an experience.
Still, I stand by my note: this tastes like cardboard.

Aimee says "it tastes so boring".

It tastes like mediocre lager.

I can say it tastes different from the Durtmunder Gold we've been enjoying lately,
and not better.


## Mouthfeel

Typical.

## Overall

Not worth a drink.

I am frustrated.
