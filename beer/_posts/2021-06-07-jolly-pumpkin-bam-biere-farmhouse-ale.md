## Smell

Smells sour and acidic,
like sour candy.

Wild and wierd. Lime, maybe?

## Taste

Oh, yeah. That's wierd.
It's funky. I wish I knew how to describe it.

It's also hard to rate.
I don't think this is bad,
but it is challenging,
and I don't think we'll finish it.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

I enjoyed this less than other similar beers I've had,
but it's so strange and challenging to drink that I could see myself reacting differently
to it based on a lot of personal factors.
