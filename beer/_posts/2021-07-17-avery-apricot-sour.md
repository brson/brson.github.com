Apricot Sour.
Avery Brewing Co.
Boulder, CO.

7% ABV.

"Sour ale with apricots added, aged in oak barrels".

Another Colorado brewery,
this one recommended to me on Twitter.
Picked this up at the local Whole Foods.

Don't think I've ever had a barrel aged sour ale.

Reading the bottle, the ingredients sound impressive:
saccharomyces yeast, brettanomyces yeast, lactobacillus, pediococcus.
Complicated.

It looks amazing. Hazy apricot colored.
Big bubbly head.

There are some huge pieces of sediment at the bottom of the glass,
which does not look appetizing.
Maybe I should not have poured the whole bottle.

I can smell the sour from across the table.

Notes of stone fruits.
Apricot yeah.
There's a bit of an unpleasant funk,
rotting fruit.

Yup it tastes like a sour ale.
The apricot doesn't really come through.
The barrel aging doesn't speak here either.
Totally dominated by the sourness from the yeasts.

It does though bring to mind another aged sour
beer we experienced,
though that was a much worse beer.
It has a bit of muted, earthy, muddiness to it,
as opposed to being bright, crisp, refreshing.
Could be an effect of barrel aging.

Super fizzy mouthfeel.

It's not great fun to drink.

3/5
