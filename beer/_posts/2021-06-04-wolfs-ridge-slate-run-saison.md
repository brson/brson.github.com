title: Wolf's Ridge Slate Run Saison
---
Slate Run.
Wolf's Ridge Brewing.
Columbus, OH.

4.8% ABV.

A saison.

This beer appears to be canned in the can of another beer:
there's some kind of sticker wrapped around the can
that has been applied by hand,
and is covering the original can branding.

## Appearance

Sickly pale yellow.

## Smell

First impression is sour and sweet.
But then I receive a hit of ... horse manure!
A stable!

## Taste

Oh that is bad.
This is a disaster.
I think the brewer made a mistake.

It's undrinkable.

I take two sips but am not willing to drink more.

## Mouthfeel

I didn't drink enough to notice.
