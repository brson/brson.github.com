## Smell

Faint.

So faint I want to give up and just say I can't smell anything.

A bit of apple?

Once again I get my nose so close that I just inhale a bunch of lager.
It's not great.
Note: this is not a good beer for inhaling.
Though, really, it's probably about the best beer for inhaling.
I don't want to inhale a porter.

I just want to drink a porter.

Mmmm...

Meanwhile, Aimee is trying to google why lagers taste like pee.
Is everything smelling like pee a covid symptom?

## Taste

I make a face when I taste it,
and say "oh, man".

After that ros√© I was looking to drink a good beer.

This isn't it.

It tastes cheap, and dull,
probably marginally better than a typical macrobrew lager.

Aimee says "rubber",
and I try to get on her level:
the lingering flavor in my mouth does make me imagine sucking on some industrial chemical.

## Mouthfeel

It's thankfully very thin.

## Overall

Argh,
I keep going back hoping for something,
and it's just boring.

It's super boring.
We dump the rest in the sink and open a Two-Hearted.

I've still not had a good beer from Rhinegeist.
