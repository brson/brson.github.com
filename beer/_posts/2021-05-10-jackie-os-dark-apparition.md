Dark Apparition.
Jackie O's.
Athens, OH.

13.8 ABV.

Bourbon barrel aged stout.
Previously my favorite type of brew.

## Appearance

Pours like crude oil molasses.
Pitch black.
Almost no head, but what's there is very brown.

## Smell

Vanilla, caramel, molasses, cocoa.

We are foolishly dooring a tasting while preparing a meat-heavy dinner in the kitchen.
We periodically open the door and step outside to smell the fresh air,
and the stout beer.

Smells like ... bacon.

## Taste

Super sweet. Super vanilla.
Chcocolate.

This is a lot like a bourbon-infused chocolate.

## Mouthfeel

Syrupy.

## Overall

It's representative of the style,
but too sweet for my current tastes.
It's been a while since I've had it,
but this seems easier to drink than the Goose Island aged stout,
though less interesting.
