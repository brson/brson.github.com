## Appearance

Caramel brown.
Fizzy head with big soda-like bubbles.

## Smell

Soy sauce. Hope that's not a bad sign.
Some malty caramel like a doppelbock.

Aimee again detects "loquat leaf extract".
I again don't know what that is.

## Taste

The malty-caramelly flavor is there,
but it's also artificial and medicinal.

It's not great.

## Mouthfeel

Strangely flat for how bubbly it poured.

## Overall

Terrible mouthfeel,
taste doesn't campare well to other doppelbocks.

We didn't finish it.
