## Taste

It's a strong taste,
that's hard to separate from the thick mouthfeel.

It's complex,
mostly bitter with that distinct lactose flavor.
It's hard to say it is sweet because of the strong bitterness,
but it is sweet.

Citrus rind.
Some honey.

It's very bitter.

## Mouthfeel

Surprisingly thick.

## Overall

It's a strong beer.
I am drunk.

I continue to not love the addition of lactose.
It's a distinct sweetness,
but not all that delicious.

Still, this beer seems representative of the milkshake IPA style.
