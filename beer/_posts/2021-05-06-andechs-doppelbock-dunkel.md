Doppelbock Dunkel.
Andechs.
Andechs, Germany.

7.1% ABV.

I used to drink this a lot in San Francisco.
Last fall, in Rochester, I was looking out for doppelbocks and couldn't find them.
Not really craving one now,
but excited to refresh my memory.

## Appearance

Relatively light head that I poured a bit aggressively to get to foam up.
Dark caramel colored.

## Smell

Super malty. Caramel. Burnt sugar.

Aimee says "loquat extract".
I do not know what loquat is.
She clarifies that it is not fresh loquat, but the extract.

## Taste

First thing I notice is the mouthfeel. Thick.

The taste is just straight malt drink.
Not subtle.

There's some undertone on the aftertaste here that I really dislike,
and that I can't quite identify.

Something swampy.

The first thing that hits is the heavy malt flavor,
then that fades away and leaves a light bitterness just coating the mouth.

## Mouthfeel

Syrupy and flat.
Just sits on your tongue.
Not pleasant.

## Overall

This is fascinatingly dissappointing.
I used to drink this beer a lot.

It's extremely boring.
Just dark roasted malt.

The lack of carbination really hurts.
Maybe this one has been sitting a long time.
