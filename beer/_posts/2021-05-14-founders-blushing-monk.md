## Smell

Smells like raspberry juice, or cranberry juice.

## Taste

I dig it.
Surprisingly pleasant.

Tastes like a complex cran-raspberry juice.

Doesn't taste like beer,
doesn't taste alcoholic,
though it is super-alcoholic.

No, I can taste the underlying typical Belgian yeasty-sour flavor.

Maybe a bit of cloves.

It tastes really good.

The aftertaste isn't all that pleasant.

## Mouthfeel

A bit syrupy.

## Overall

A nice surprise.
Too sweet for regular drinking.

I'd like to cook this down and put it on a cheesecake.
