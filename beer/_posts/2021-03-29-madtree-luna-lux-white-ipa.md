title: Madtree Luna Lux White IPA
---
Luna Lux White IPA.
Madtree Brewing.
Cincinnati, OH.

6.0% ABV.

First white IPA I've had.
I expect it to be like a Hoegaarden, but with more hops.

We just had a great workout in the park,
so we are counting on this to be refreshing and restorative.

Let's drink!

## Appearance

Golden and effervescent with a foamy white head.

## Smell

I said, "aw the smell is great".
A bit of citrus.
Swirling it reveals a bit of spice.

## Taste

I tell Aimee, who has already tasted it,
this should be like a Hoegaarden crossed with an IPA,
and she says "Hoegaarden?! Nooooo,"
and proceeds to tell me at length about 1664,
which I have not heard of,
and which is apparently loved by women in China.
She does not though say this tastes like 1664.

Anyway, _I_ think it tastes like an IPA.
Unless you told me (which the can did),
I might not even suspect it contains adjuncts.

Aftertaste is a bit unpleasant.
Not atypical for a hoppy beer.

## Mouthfeel

A bit thick.
The bitterness lingers on the sides of the mouth.

## Overall

It's an uninteresting IPA.
It doesn't achieve what its branding claims.
Pretty big letdown.
