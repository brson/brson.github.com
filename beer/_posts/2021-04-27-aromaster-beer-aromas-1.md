Today we're doing a different exercise &mdash;
we're going to have some smell practice.

On many occassions when we taste beer we find ourselves frustrated with our inability to
pick out tasting "notes" &mdash; you know, when someone says "I get a hint of grass on the nose",
or something like that.

Mostly I just taste malt, and hops;
and if a beer is a stout, maybe chocolate, or coffee;
and if it's a good IPA maybe some varieties of citrus.

Sometimes I'll just reach for something and make up something imaginative to have something interesting to say.

So we got an "aroma kit":

<img class="beer-photo" src="/beer/images/2021-04-27-aromaster-beer-aromas-1.jpg"/>

It's got twelve bottles of essential oils or something,
smells that you might expect in beers.

Let's stick our nose in four of them and see what we experience!


## Lemon

It's lemon.
I feel confident I can pick out lemon flavor.
We use lemons most every day in cooking.

Sour.


## Apple

It's tart.
Like a green apple.
Not like a red apple.

I feel silly about this exercise
and wonder if I could pick out this flavor while sipping a beer.

I decide now is an opportunity to really embed this flavor in my brain.

I have Aimee wave the bottle under my nose several times while I say
"green apple, green apple, green apple".

Tart and sweet.

Green apple, green apple, green apple.


## Pear

I say "pear" before opening this one and sticking it under Aimee's face.

This time while I am chanting pears,
I look at the card that accompanies the kit,
with pictures of every aroma.
I visualize "pear", I say "pear".

Aimee approaches with a bag of open coffee beans and says,
"you want to clean your nose?"

I know she is asking if I want to stick my nose in the bag of coffee,
as if that will cleanse my palate,
and I am doubtful.

I stick my nose in the bag of coffee and inhale deeply.

I love the smell of roasted coffee beans.

Coffee also a good beer aroma.

I chant "coffee, coffee, coffee".


## Melon

I don't know what kind of melon is in the picture.
Honeydew?

I just chant "melon, melon, melon".

It's a rounder scent, doesn't suggest acid like the lemon or pear.

Aimee is distracted with her laptop,
a final-generation Intel MacBook that she has been supremely disappointed.


## Thoughts

I am somewhat dismayed at the collection of scents here,
as I think I know these well.
Though I might not think of "melon" while drinking beer,
so having these primed in my brain seems like a worthwhile exercise.

Now to taste a beer.
