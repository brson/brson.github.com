## Appearance

Ugly brown like dirtwater.
Minimal head.

## Smell

Toffee.
Soy sauce.

Bottle has even stronger soy sauce.

It's not appetizing.

## Taste

Woah, this knocked me back.
It's unusual.
Very sour.
Candy.

It has a flavor I can't place,
as so often happens.

Aimee says "hawthorn jelly".
What is that?
I have no idea what hawthorn tastes like,
let alone hawthorn jelly.

Hawthorn jelly it is.

Aftertaste is pretty gross.

## Mouthfeel

I bit viscous.

## Overall

Challenging.
Not great today,
but maybe as I drink more sour beers I will learn to appreciate it.
