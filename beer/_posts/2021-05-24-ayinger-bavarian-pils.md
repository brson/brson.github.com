Bavarian Pils.
Ayinger.
Aying, Germany.

5.3% ABV.

We've [reviewed this before][lasttime] and loved it a lot.
It got us interested in pilsners,
and since then we've had many.
Let's see if we still love it.

## Appearance

Light straw yellow. Translucent. Moderate head.

Slightly lighter color than the Bell's we just tried.

## Smell

Faint grain.
Not much from the bottle either.

## Taste

Sweeter and less bitter than the Bell's.

Some malt and honey.

There's some kind of unpleasant aftertaste,
something funky.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

Aimee thinks it's boring.
I kind of agree.

It's not as thirst-quenching as the Wiedemann's Pilsner.
