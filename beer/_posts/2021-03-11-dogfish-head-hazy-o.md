Hazy-O!
Dogfish Head Brewery.
Milton, DE.

7.1% ABV.

Their 120 Minute IPA was an object of desire for me last year,
and I'll drink the 60 Minute IPA any time.
Been eyeballing this one for a while.

First beer review after several months break,
after having my gallbladder removed.

I swore I would never drink again.

## Appearance

Bright yellow as it pours out of the can.
I was making "ooh" sounds.

Looks juicy and bright and hazy orange in the glass.

## Smell

Juicy, juicy. Grapefruit.

Aimee says "pineapple".

Oh, yeah, definitely pineapple. Glass of pineapple juice here.

## Taste

It's yummy.

It does not though taste like pineapple juice.

I read the can and see that it is made with oats and oat milk,
usually said to give beer a "smooth" mouthfeel.

The hoppiness is not overwhelming.
It lingers for a while.

By the end of the glass
there's something about the hops here that I don't love.
It's a biting, sharp, flavor.
I just keep noticing the hops and not quite digging it.

## Mouthfeel

Aimee thinks it has a smooth feel.
Compared to Two-Hearted,
one of our go-tos,
she thinks that one has a more "honey" feel
(which I interpret to mean "syrupy" and thick)
than this.

## Overall

We drink this fast.

Aimee approves.

I approve.
