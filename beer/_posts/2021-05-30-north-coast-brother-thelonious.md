## Smell

Banana.
Caramel.
Candy.
Cinnamon.
Bananas Foster.

Aimee disagrees with cinnamon,
and says "honey candy".

I'm excited about the banana,
haven't smelled that before in a beer.

## Taste

Surprisingly vegetal.
Cooked celery.

Sweet.

I am so surprised that the smell promised bananas,
and the taste delivered celery.

Fish now.
What?
Fish?

Every time I taste it it gets worse.
