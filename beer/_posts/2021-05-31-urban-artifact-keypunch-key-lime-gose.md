## Appearance

Hazy, light yellow. Straw. A little bit of orange.
Tightly laced foam.

## Smell

Slight sour citrus,
like a sour candy.

Some funk to it.

## Taste

Aimee tastes first and exclaims, "oh",
but not the good kind of "oh",
more like she stubbed her toe.

I say "huh".

It's a pretty mellow sour.

But it's a wierd taste.
Definitely some key lime,
the it's not the refrishing taste I expect from fresh lime.

The limeness is kinda ruined.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

I don't hate it.

Aimee seems to.

Hard for me to judge a gose yet.
They're all wierd.
