Hazy brown-gold.
Big foamy head.

## Smell

Just a crisp, light, malt.

Aimee says "cucumber".
Good note.

## Taste

A surprising sweetness, some fruity candy.

A bit vegetal.
On second thought, quite a bit vegetal, not so much candy now.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

This is kinda middle-of-the-road.
It's good, but not exciting.

Not as refreshing as some pilsners,
with more hops flavor.
