Bohemian Golden Pilsner.
Wiedemann Brewing.
Cincinnati, OH.

5.0% ABV.

This is the one.
The beer that redeems Cincinnati's entire brewing scene.

Aimee learned of this brewery from the news of the ["Cincinnati's Favorite Beer 2021"][fav] competition,
which seems to be run by the Cincinnati Enquirer.
This beer was the winner,
and we had the good luck to find it in stock at a nearby Kroger.

We've already tasted it,
and there's good news ahead.

## Appearance

Easy pour.
Not a lot of frothing on the head.
Classic golden effervescent color.

Handsome old school can.

## Smell

Mild and bready-yeasty.
Nothing special.

Aimee observes there is no pee-pee smell,
which I take to be a plus.

## Taste

Clean and crisp.

Mostly notable for the lack of bad flavors or aftertaste.

Mild classic hops bitterness.
So balanced.

I insist on a tiny hint of banana.
Real tiny.

It's so simple that I feel strange giving it a 5 of 5 for taste,
but it's such a great example of a simple classic.

## Mouthfeel

Goes down real easy.
No lingering syrupiness coating the mouth.

## Overall

Great everyday go-to beer.

Excellent example of the style.
I don't have a lot of pilsner experience,
and most of the ones I've had I didn't love.
My benchmark for the style is Ayinger Pils,
which I loved a lot.

I'd love to compare the two directly,
perhaps with a Pilsner Urquell and a Budweiser
in the mix.

If I could give this more than a 5 I would.
It's a perfect example of a classic style.

This is a beer to convert people who only know bad beer.
