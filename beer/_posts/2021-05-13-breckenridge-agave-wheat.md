Cloudy gold.
Aime thinks pineapple color.

Thin head that dissipates immediately.

## Smell

The smell is faint.
And weird.

It's slightly funky,
like there's something wrong with it.

What is the smell?

Mushroom?
I'm picturing something slimy.

Oh, that smell.
Every time I come back it's worse.

I can't put it into words.
Maybe grassy, or herbacious.
No, it's not that.
Maybe rotting meat.

Yes, rotting meat.

## Taste

Well that's not unpleasant.
But not too special either.
That slightly funky aroma continues in the tasting.

## Mouthfeel

Fine.

## Overall

The agave does not improve the beer,
just makes a decent beer slightly worse.

We did not finish.
