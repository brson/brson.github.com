title: Rust core team alumni

There doesn't seem to be a complete record of who was on individual teams in the
Rust project, with past members historically being recorded simply as [Rust team
alumni][rta]. So I've read through the resources that do exist to make a list of
past members of the Rust core team and document the history of its formation.

[rta]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/alumni

The public record doesn't make it clear when the Rust core team was formed,
though there are references to the phrase "core team" on the mailing list as far
back as November 2012. At that point it was an informal designation, with people
employed full-time by Mozilla Research on Rust seemingly self-identifying as
being on the core team. This would have included:

- [Brian Anderson]
- [Graydon Hoare]
- [Niko Matsakis]
- [Patrick Walton]
- [Tim Chevalier]

In the early days [Marijn Haverbeke] and [Rafael Ávila de Espindola] were
also employed on Rust, probably predating the notion of a core team.

In October 2013 a [page was added to the wiki][wiki] identifying the Rust core
team as:

- [Alex Crichton]
- [Brian Anderson]
- [Felix Klock]
- [Niko Matsakis]
- [Patrick Walton]
- [Tim Chevalier]

[wiki]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-wiki-backup/commit/62db7ee8a0fad584f18fc886069e59aaf8e2b735#diff-8e8933599680def436f5c7df750d85b01c0cdd14e6f30bb2e0b1cc01723e9d12

These were again the full-time employees of Mozilla Research working on Rust.

It was in early 2014 when the roster that mantains clear continuity with
today's core team was established, and the only record I see of it is [this
commit that removes core team members][rm] from the wiki. The core
team at that point was:

[rm]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-wiki-backup/commit/30b5791e7f1f4a8850be9f7699783227539e251f#diff-8e8933599680def436f5c7df750d85b01c0cdd14e6f30bb2e0b1cc01723e9d12

- [Alex Crichton]
- [Brian Anderson]
- [Niko Matsakis]
- [Patrick Walton]

That was a time of extensive internal discussion about Rust's long-term
sustainability and governance structure. These people became the core team by
fiat, with the blessing of [Dave Herman], still all employees of Mozilla
Research. During 2014, [Huon Wilson] and then [Aaron Turon], were added to the core
team, the first deliberate decisions by the team to expand, Aaron's appointment
announced [on the forum][aforum], Huon's seemingly not mentioned anywhere; and
in December 2014 [Yehuda Katz] and [Steve Klabnik] were added to the team,
announced [via blog post][added].

[added]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/12/12/Core-Team.html

Rust's governance structure was not made official until February 2015,
in [RFC 1068], the RFC process itself [predating any formal definition
of the Rust team structure][rfcintro], but also happening concurrently
with the quiet establishment of the 2014 core team.

[RFC 1068]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1068-rust-governance.md
[rfcintro]: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-March/008973.html

Using 2014 as the starting point of what is today considered the core team,
here is a full list of those who have been on the Rust core team:

- [Aaron Turon]
- [Aidan Hobson Sayers]
- [Alex Crichton]
- [Ashley Williams]
- [Brian Anderson]
- [Caral Nichols]
- [Erick Tryzelaar]
- [Florian Gilcher]
- [Huon Wilson]
- [Jan-Erik Rediger]
- [JT]
- [Manish Goregaokar]
- [Mark Rousskov]
- [Nick Cameron]
- [Niko Matsakis]
- [Patrick Walton]
- [Pietro Albini]
- [Ryan Levick]
- [Steve Klabnik]
- [Yehuda Katz]
